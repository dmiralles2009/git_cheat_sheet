## Overview
Collection of very handy set of git commands when working in distributed system hosted in GitHub or other platforms. 
After using Git for a while I came to realize that there was a set of commands that you should learn to use Git in your daily coding tasks.
The documentation is a work in progress and feedback is welcome. However bare in mind that the format and the examples are mainly focused in grouping the most used commands and in its specific options.
